CASA: Covering Arrays by Simulated Annealing
============================================

[CASA](https://cse.unl.edu/~citportal/) is a tool originally developed by [Brady J. Garvin](https://cse.unl.edu/~bgarvin/) at University of Nebraskaâ€”Lincoln.

This repository is a copy of the source code for version 1.1b of the tool, with a slightly modified Makefile to fix compilation errors.

I am putting this code on the repository as it is licensed as free software, but I am not otherwise associated to CASA.

Please see the file `doc.txt` for instructions on how to use the tool written by the original author.
